# IoT Application Programming
## About this material
This material introduces the main components for programming simple IoT applications for undergraduate studtens which have completed a basic computer programming course. The main goal is to extend basic computer programs which most likely use the keyboard and screen as inputs and outputs to applications that can interacts with remote IoT nodes (which are available on an online laboratory). The use of soecific network protocols such HTTP and MQTT is explained with practical examples using Python language. Besides, this language is also used to discuss data storage and analysis models.

## Main topics
* IoT Network Architecture 
* IoT Data Flow Models: Push and Pull   
* IoT Network Protocols: HTTP and MQTT
* IoT Data Storage Models: Time-based and Realtional-based
* IoT Visualization Tools
* IoT Analytic Models: Descriptive and Predictive

## What you will learn
* Collect sensor data from remote nodes using different network protocols
* Visualize collected data using diferent formats and graphics
* Run analysis on collected data and produce data outputs  
* Send data to remote nodes and trigger actions

## What you will need:
* Basic knowledge of Python language
* Computer with Internet access
