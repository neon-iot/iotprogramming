# IoT Application Programming
## About this material
This material introduces the main components for programming simple IoT applications for undergraduate students with basic computer programming skills. The main goal is to extend basic computer programs which most likely use the keyboard and screen as inputs and outputs to applications that can interacts with IoT nodes connected to Internet. This material can be included in any computer programming course to build and demonstrate simple IoT applications using little code. In particular, the design and implementation of an IoT application for classroom enviromental monitoring is considered. This application has to be capable of sensing enviromental conditions (temperature, humidity, light) in the classroom and indicate their values or specific events by means of a RGB led. This project is developed through 5 modules, each of which discuss how to implement an IoT classroom monitor application based on a given set of programming skills. The first module starts with an IoT application assuming minimal progamming skills. Each of the following modules progressively assume new skills which help to improve the original IoT application. 

## Main topics
* IoT Device: architecture 
* IoT Data Flow Models: Push and Pull   
* IoT Network Protocols: HTTP and MQTT
* IoT Data Storage Models: Time-based and Realtional-based
* IoT Data Visualization: 
* IoT Analytic Models: Descriptive and Predictive

## What you will learn
* Collect sensor data from remote nodes using a network protocol
* Visualize collected data using diferent formats and graphics
* Run analysis on collected data and produce data outputs  
* Send data to remote nodes and trigger actions

## What you will need:
* Basic knowledge of Python language
* Computer with Internet access
