# IoT Application Programming
## About this material
This material introduces the main components for programming simple IoT applications for undergraduate studtens which have completed a basic computer programming course. The main goal is to extend basic programming concepts like inputs and outputs to computer programas so that IoT 

co various protocols designed for the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications

## Main topics
* IoT Network Architecture 
* IoT Data Flow Models: Push and Pull   
* IoT Network Protocols: HTTP and MQTT
* IoT Data Storage Models: Time-based and Realtional-based
* IoT Visualization Tools
* IoT Analytic Models: Descriptive and Predictive

## What you will learn
* Collect sensor data from remote nodes using different network protocols
* Visualize collected data using diferent formats and graphics
* Run analysis on collected data and produce data outputs  
* Send data to remote nodes and trigger actions

## What you will need:
* Basic knowledge of Python language
* Computer with Internet access
